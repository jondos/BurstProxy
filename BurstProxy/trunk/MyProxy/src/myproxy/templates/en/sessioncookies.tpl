These rules work exactly like the
<a href="/cookierules" class="local">$TPL_COOKIERULES</a>, only that matching
cookies will be modified so that your browser discards them at the end of the
session. This is useful for sites that refuse to work without cookies, but
offer nothing much in return. Limiting the cookie lifetime at least makes
long-term tracking a little harder.
