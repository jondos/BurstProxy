If a URL is to be blocked, it is additionally compared to the rules in this
list. Instead of blocking a matching request, the proxy redirects the browser
to a transparent image, 1x1 pixels in size. This looks much nicer compared to
the "broken image" icon most browsers display for unavailable images.
